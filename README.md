# Covid-Tracking-System
Its an IoT based Covid Tracking System using ESP8266 and API.

In this project I use the district wise data from this URL https://api.covid19india.org/state_district_wise.json
I don't wants to track all districts, so I customize that data and write a new script and route that data to my website.
Then from my website URL https://kearnux.000webhostapp.com, I call that customize data in ESP8266 and print it on Serial Terminal in Arduino IDE.

You can use any display (LCD, TFT, OLED, etc) to show it on Screen.
